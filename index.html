        <h2> About </h2>
        <p>
            I am a doctoral candidate in philosophy at the University of Maryland, College Park. My primary research projects are in philosophy of science (especially biology), philosophy of race, and political philosophy. In addition, I am pursuing research in bioethics
            and philosophy of economics. In my projects, I often draw on the theoretical and experimental tools of biology to illuminate broader issues in philosophy of race and social and political philosophy.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my dissertation project, I develop the philosophical foundations of the new mechanist approach to explanation. My research draws on the life sciences, especially molecular biology, evolutionary theory,and neuroscience, to illustrate my philosophical theses.

        </p>
        <p>In philosophy of race, I have research interests at the intersection of race, biomedicine, and political domination. Specifically, I am interested in the ways the social and political exposome racialized groups find themselves in shape their biomedical
            outcomes.
        </p>

        <p>In political philosophy, my main projects are in developing a scientifically-informed account of rationality for use in contractarianism and in developing a novel account of domination. </p>

                        Racial disparities in health outcomes have recently become a fashpoint in the debate about the value of race as a biological concept. What role, if any, race has in the etiology of disease is a philosophically and scientifcally contested topic. In this
                        article, I expand on the insights of the new mechanistic philosophy of science to defend a mechanism discovery approach to investigating epidemiological racial disparities. The mechanism discovery approach has explanatory virtues
                        lacking in the populational approach typically employed in the study of race and biomedicine. The explanatory constraints that form an integral part of the new mechanistic approach enable mechanism discovery to avoid the epistemic
                        and normative shortcomings of the populational approach. The methodology of mechanism discovery can fruitfully be extended to the treatment and reversal of epidemiological racial disparities.
