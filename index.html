I am a doctoral candidate in philosophy at the University of Maryland, College Park. My primary research projects are in philosophy of science (especially biology), philosophy of race, and political philosophy. In addition, I am pursuing research in bioethics and philosophy of economics. In my projects, I often draw on the theoretical and experimental tools of biology to illuminate broader issues in philosophy of race and social and political philosophy.
</p> 
<p>

 In my dissertation project, I develop the philosophical foundations of the new mechanist approach to explanation.

</p>
<p>In philosophy of race, I have research interests at the intersection of race, biomedicine, and political domination. Specifically, I am interested in the ways the social and political exposome racialized groups find themselves in shape their biomedical outcomes.</p>

 <p>In political philosophy, my main projects are in developing a scientifically-informed account of rationality for use in contractarianism and in developing a novel account of domination.  </p>

<p> Racial disparities in health outcomes have recently become a fashpoint in the
debate about the value of race as a biological concept. What role, if any, race has
in the etiology of disease is a philosophically and scientifcally contested topic. In
this article, I expand on the insights of the new mechanistic philosophy of science to
defend a mechanism discovery approach to investigating epidemiological racial disparities. The mechanism discovery approach has explanatory virtues lacking in the
populational approach typically employed in the study of race and biomedicine. The
explanatory constraints that form an integral part of the new mechanistic approach
enable mechanism discovery to avoid the epistemic and normative shortcomings of
the populational approach. The methodology of mechanism discovery can fruitfully
be extended to the treatment and reversal of epidemiological racial disparities.
