        <h2> About </h2>
        <p>
            I am a Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of Leeds. Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society at Stanford University. I received my PhD in philosophy at the University of Maryland, College Park. 
       </p>
        
         <p> My primary research projects are in philosophy of science (especially biology), philosophy of race, and political philosophy. In addition, I am pursuing research in the ethics and political theory of algorithmic governance. In my projects, I often draw on the theoretical and experimental tools of biology to illuminate broader issues in philosophy of race and social and political philosophy.
        </p>
        <p>
            My main research interest is scientific explanation in the life sciences. In my dissertation project, On the Activities and Parts of the Mechanisms of Life, I develop the philosophical foundations of the new mechanist approach to explanation. My research draws on the life sciences, especially molecular biology, evolutionary theory, and neuroscience, to illustrate my philosophical theses.

        </p>
        <p>In philosophy of race, I have research interests at the intersection of race and biomedicine. Specifically, I am interested in how we use race as an explanatory concept in medical research, and the ways the exposome racialized groups are subject to shape their biomedical
            outcomes.
        </p>

        <p>In political philosophy, my main projects are in developing a novel electoral system, defending an account of domination and neo-republican theory for use in AI ethics, and theories of compensation. </p>

                       Lockdowns were a morally and medically appropriate anti-contagion policy to stop the spead of Covid. However, lockdowns came with considerable costs. Specifically, lockdowns imposed harms and losses upon the young in order to benefit the elderly, who were 
                       at the highest risk of severe illness and death from Covid. This represened a shifting of the (epidimiological) burden of Covid for the elderly to a systemic burden of lockdowns upon the young. This paper argues that even if lockdowns were a morally permissible 
                       reponse to Covid, the harms and losses they imposed on the young ground a claim of compensation. I defend an Intergenerational Compensation Argument that defends a claim for an egalitarian intergenerational transfer to compensate the young for the harms of lockdown.

                        Racial disparities in health outcomes have recently become a fashpoint in the debate about the value of race as a biological concept. What role, if any, race has in the etiology of disease is a philosophically and scientifcally contested topic. In this
                        article, I expand on the insights of the new mechanistic philosophy of science to defend a mechanism discovery approach to investigating epidemiological racial disparities. The mechanism discovery approach has explanatory virtues
                        lacking in the populational approach typically employed in the study of race and biomedicine. The explanatory constraints that form an integral part of the new mechanistic approach enable mechanism discovery to avoid the epistemic
                        and normative shortcomings of the populational approach. The methodology of mechanism discovery can fruitfully be extended to the treatment and reversal of epidemiological racial disparities.
